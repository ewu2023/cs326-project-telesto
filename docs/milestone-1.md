# Application Idea
The purpose of Medication Monitor is to help patients and caretakers manage and keep track of their medications. To this end, the application will use data about a patientâ€™s various medications such as the name and type of the medication, the amount to take per dose, and any other special instructions for consumption. Additionally, the application will also take time-based data such as the frequency of consumption for each medication, as well as the expiration and refill dates.

# Functionality
The goal of the Medication Monitor app is to provide users a means of cataloging information about the various medications one may be prescribed, as well as maintaining important dates such as refill and expiration dates to aid in reminding users of when to replace their prescriptions. Furthermore, the application will also use data such as frequency of consumption to help users set a schedule for taking their prescriptions. Ultimately, scheduling and frequency data, as well as information provided about the medication, will be used to display an informative schedule to users that will remind them of when to take their medications, when to refill and replace them, how much they should take for each dose, and other important information about a given medication that should be noted.
